SPEAKER_B | 00:00:43 | 00:02:02 | Hey, guys, and welcome to another episode of the Joe Rogan Experience Review. This week we are reviewing Elon Musk's recent October 31, 2025 episode 2404 appearance on Rogan. Elon hasn't been on for a while. I think it was December of last year. This is a big deal. I mean, this is post Doge and he's been laying low a little bit since his departure from Doge. Yeah, I think he said he only could do 120 days as a special government employee or whatever his title was. But yeah, and he's on and he's talking about some of his findings and what else he's up to and. And all the rest of it. Quick plug to the Patreon. Thank you all for being members of that again. We've got videos and other different bits and snippets and fun things over there. So go ahead, jump over to Patreon. You can see our link in the bio. We appreciate you supporting our show goes a long way. Joined today by Brandon. How you doing, buddy?
SPEAKER_C | 00:02:02 | 00:02:27 | It's great to be here. I'm doing pretty well. I'm excited to talk about my favorite Diablo 4 player and. And yeah, man. Like it. It's. It's nice to see Elon back on the podcast. What a different episode this was from what I thought it would be. When you compare this episode with his first appearance, I thought it was night and day, personally. Yeah.
SPEAKER_B | 00:02:28 | 00:03:01 | Yeah, he's definitely in a different place. I think that he's jaded politically for sure. And also he's a very polarizing figure now. And also I would say triggering figure for sure. You bring up his name in many circles that used to love him to death and people are. You get a visceral reaction. People are upset sometimes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_C | 00:03:01 | 00:03:40 | And you look at the whole controversy with Tesla and people graffiti ing cars and trashing dealerships. He hates the Democrats. And it shows, it really does show on this episode just how red pilled he is. And again, like I said, it's so night and day compared to his first couple appearances. His time in office has changed him so much. And we'll get into that. But it was a very, very political episode. I thought it was like, what, 90% politics?
SPEAKER_B | 00:03:40 | 00:03:55 | I think pretty close. Yeah, pretty close. And if you want a Republican or very neutral, I would imagine it's pretty annoying episode too. I bet it was quite difficult to listen to, honestly.
SPEAKER_C | 00:03:55 | 00:04:07 | Yeah. It's so different from early the Rogan. Like when we're talking left wing California Rogan, like, it's like, wow, I feel like we have hit the other end of the spectrum. Like this episode has to be it.
SPEAKER_B | 00:04:08 | 00:04:21 | Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all. It's changing for sure. But you know, I mean, a lot of people in that time have changed their policies. I think even the parties themselves have changed a bunch in that time as well.
SPEAKER_C | 00:04:21 | 00:04:21 | Right.
