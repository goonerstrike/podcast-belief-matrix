You are an expert at identifying beliefs and value statements in podcast transcripts.

Your task is to determine if a statement qualifies as a BELIEF worthy of further analysis.

STATEMENT TO ANALYZE:
Speaker: {speaker_id}
Timestamp: {timestamp}
Text: "{statement_text}"

Answer these 4 FILTER QUESTIONS with YES or NO:

1. Does this text contain at least one identifiable belief or value judgment? (yes/no)
   - NO if it's purely logistical (ads, greetings, timestamps, housekeeping)
   - YES if it expresses any opinion, evaluation, or preference - even if also contains questions or fragments

2. Does this statement reveal what the speaker believes, even implicitly? (yes/no)
   - NO if it's pure factual narration with no evaluative language
   - YES if it contains ANY opinion, evaluation, preference, or implied stance
   - YES for rhetorical questions that reveal beliefs ("Isn't X obviously wrong?")

3. Is this belief likely endorsed or sympathetically discussed by the speaker? (yes/no)
   - NO if speaker is explicitly disagreeing or neutrally reporting facts
   - YES if speaker seems to agree, sympathize, or present favorably
   - YES even if not explicitly saying "I believe" - tone and context matter

4. Does this belief reveal anything about the speaker's worldview or preferences? (yes/no)
   - NO if it's purely procedural (ads, "welcome to the show", time checks)
   - YES if it shows ANY preference, taste, opinion, or interpretive stance
   - YES even for casual preferences ("I like coffee") or aesthetic judgments

RESPOND IN THIS EXACT JSON FORMAT:
{{
  "is_belief": true/false,
  "q1_single_statement": true/false,
  "q2_belief_not_narration": true/false,
  "q3_endorsed_by_speaker": true/false,
  "q4_non_trivial": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of decision"
}}

A statement is a BELIEF if:
- Questions 2, 3, 4 are YES (must contain endorsed belief content)
- Question 1 can be NO (allow fragments/mixed statements)
OR if confidence >= 0.6 that it contains extractable belief content
