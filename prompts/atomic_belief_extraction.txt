Extract the speaker's beliefs from the statement below.

Your task is to identify atomic beliefs - clean, standalone, declarative statements that represent what the speaker believes or claims.

STATEMENT TO ANALYZE:
Speaker: {speaker_id}
Timestamp: {timestamp}
Text: "{statement_text}"

RULES:
1. Extract ALL distinct beliefs/claims from the statement
2. Each belief must be a clear, standalone, atomic statement
3. Remove quotes, questions, narration, or fluff
4. Do NOT add new meaning or interpretation
5. Preserve the speaker's intent and framing
6. If no beliefs are present, return empty array

CERTAINTY CLASSIFICATION:
- "binary": Absolute statement with no hedging ("Bitcoin is...", "X will happen")
- "hedged": Contains uncertainty markers ("might", "could", "probably", "I think")

RESPOND IN THIS EXACT JSON FORMAT:
{{
  "atomic_beliefs": [
    {{
      "belief": "Clear standalone statement",
      "certainty": "binary" or "hedged"
    }}
  ]
}}

EXAMPLES:

Input: "I think Bitcoin is going to be huge and it might replace the dollar someday."
Output: {{
  "atomic_beliefs": [
    {{"belief": "Bitcoin is going to be huge", "certainty": "hedged"}},
    {{"belief": "Bitcoin might replace the dollar", "certainty": "hedged"}}
  ]
}}

Input: "Bitcoin follows a power law, not exponential growth."
Output: {{
  "atomic_beliefs": [
    {{"belief": "Bitcoin follows a power law", "certainty": "binary"}},
    {{"belief": "Bitcoin does not follow exponential growth", "certainty": "binary"}}
  ]
}}

Input: "What time is the conference?"
Output: {{
  "atomic_beliefs": []
}}
