You are an expert at classifying belief statements from podcast transcripts into a hierarchical belief matrix.

STATEMENT TO CLASSIFY:
Speaker: {speaker_id}
Timestamp: {timestamp}
Text: "{statement_text}"

This statement has already been confirmed as a BELIEF. Now classify it in detail.

CLASSIFICATION QUESTIONS:

=== CONVICTION INDICATORS (Q5-7) ===
5. Does the wording indicate strong or absolute commitment (e.g., "always/never/must/cannot")? (yes/no)
6. Does the surrounding context suggest the speaker repeats or consistently relies on this belief? (yes/no)
7. Does the speaker defend or justify this belief against alternatives or objections? (yes/no)

=== BELIEF TYPE (Q8-13) ===
8. Is this belief about the fundamental nature of reality, human nature, purpose, or the structure of existence? (yes/no)
9. Is this belief about how truth/knowledge should be formed, who/what to trust, or how to evaluate information? (yes/no)
10. Is this belief about broad moral principles of right/wrong or good/bad that apply across many situations? (yes/no)
11. Is this belief a cross-domain principle or rule the speaker applies in multiple areas of life? (yes/no)
12. Is this belief primarily about large-scale systems/institutions (state, markets, money, religion, tech, law, etc.) that shapes many of their views? (yes/no)
13. Is this belief mainly about one specific domain (e.g., Bitcoin, real estate, AI, health, education, geopolitics)? (yes/no)

=== CLAIM TYPE (Q14-15) ===
14. Is this statement a concrete, testable, or time-bound claim (prediction, number, causal claim, empirical assertion)? (yes/no)
15. Is this statement best interpreted as a casual preference, offhand comment, joke, brand line, or exploratory musing? (yes/no)

=== TIER CLASSIFICATION (Q16-26) ===
Based on the above, which tier does this belief belong to?

16. Should this be labeled as a **Core Axiom** (foundational, cross-domain, defended, stable)? (yes/no)
17. Should this be labeled as a **Worldview Pillar** (big-picture moral/political/economic/epistemic/spiritual frame)? (yes/no)
18. Should this be labeled as an **Identity-Defining Value** ("this is who I am / we are")? (yes/no)
19. Should this be labeled as a **Meta-Principle** (rule for how to choose/update beliefs)? (yes/no)
20. Should this be labeled as a **Cross-Domain Rule or Heuristic** (action rule used in many contexts)? (yes/no)
21. Should this be labeled as a **Stable Domain Belief** (consistent stance within one topic)? (yes/no)
22. Should this be labeled as a **Repeated Strategy or Playbook** (tactic the speaker endorses/uses)? (yes/no)
23. Should this be labeled as a **Concrete Claim or Prediction**? (yes/no)
24. Should this be labeled as a **Situational Opinion tied to a narrow context**? (yes/no)
25. Should this be labeled as a **Loose Take / Joke / Aesthetic Vibe**? (yes/no)

26. What is the SINGLE BEST-FITTING tier? (choose ONE from Q16-25)

=== SCORING (Q27-28) ===
27. On a 0–1 scale, how strong is the speaker's conviction in this belief? (0.0-1.0)
28. On a 0–1 scale, how stable/long-term does this belief appear given the context? (0.0-1.0)

=== CATEGORIZATION (Q29-31) ===
29. What is the single best-fitting category label for this belief?
    (Choose ONE: epistemic, moral, political, economic, spiritual, social, tech, health, bitcoin/finance, other)
29b. Provide a short SUB-DOMAIN or topic label (1-4 words) that specifies the concrete focus inside that category
     (e.g., "self-custody", "archaeology methods", "AI safety"). Use lowercase slug-style phrasing.
     If no clear sub-domain exists, return "general".

30. In one short phrase, what higher-level belief or axiom does this belief most likely instantiate or rely on?
    (This is the "parent_hint" - leave empty if this seems foundational)

31. Does this belief explicitly reject or oppose another belief/group/position (i.e., define an in-group vs out-group)? (yes/no)
