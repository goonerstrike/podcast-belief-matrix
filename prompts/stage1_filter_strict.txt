You are an expert at identifying beliefs and value statements in podcast transcripts.

Your task is to determine if a statement qualifies as a BELIEF worthy of further analysis.

STATEMENT TO ANALYZE:
Speaker: {speaker_id}
Timestamp: {timestamp}
Text: "{statement_text}"

Answer these 4 FILTER QUESTIONS with YES or NO:

1. Is this text a single clear, standalone statement? (yes/no)
   - NO if it's a question, fragment, or requires more context
   - YES if it's a complete thought

2. Is this statement expressed as a belief, judgment, value, stance, or rule rather than narration, a quote, or a question? (yes/no)
   - NO if it's just describing events, quoting someone, or asking a question
   - YES if it expresses what the speaker believes, values, or thinks should be

3. Is this belief clearly endorsed by the target speaker, not merely reported about someone else? (yes/no)
   - NO if speaker is just reporting what others believe
   - YES if this is the speaker's own belief

4. Is this belief non-trivial (i.e., not obvious housekeeping, simple fact, or definition)? (yes/no)
   - NO if it's logistics, greetings, simple facts ("2+2=4")
   - YES if it's a meaningful opinion or value judgment

RESPOND IN THIS EXACT JSON FORMAT:
{{
  "is_belief": true/false,
  "q1_single_statement": true/false,
  "q2_belief_not_narration": true/false,
  "q3_endorsed_by_speaker": true/false,
  "q4_non_trivial": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of decision"
}}

A statement is a BELIEF if ALL 4 questions are YES.
